# When you divide any two numbers, even if they are integers that result in a
# whole number, you’ll always get a float


# If you mix an integer and a float in any other operation, you’ll get a
# float as well


# Underscores in Numbers
# When you’re writing long numbers, you can group digits using underscores
# to make large numbers more readable:

num = 14_3232_3434_232523

# When you print a number that was defined using underscores, Python
# prints only the digits

print(num)

# Constants
# A constant is like a variable whose value stays the same throughout the life
# of a program. Python doesn’t have built-in constant types, but Python programmers use all capital letters to indicate a variable should be treated as a
# constant and never be changed
