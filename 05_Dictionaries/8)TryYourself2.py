# 6-4. Glossary 2: Now that you know how to loop through a dictionary, clean
# up the code from Exercise 6-3 (page 99) by replacing your series of print()
# calls with a loop that runs through the dictionary’s keys and values. When
# you’re sure that your loop works, add five more Python terms to your glossary.
# When you run your program again, these new words and meanings should
# automatically be included in the output.
# 6-5. Rivers: Make a dictionary containing three major rivers and the country
# each river runs through. One key-value pair might be 'nile': 'egypt'.
# •	 Use a loop to print a sentence about each river, such as The Nile runs
# through Egypt.
# •	 Use a loop to print the name of each river included in the dictionary.
# •	 Use a loop to print the name of each country included in the dictionary.
# 6-6. Polling: Use the code in favorite_languages.py (page 97).
# •	 Make a list of people who should take the favorite languages poll. Include
# some names that are already in the dictionary and some that are not.
# •	 Loop through the list of people who should take the poll. If they have
# already taken the poll, print a message thanking them for responding.
# If they have not yet taken the poll, print a message inviting them to take
# the poll.
