# 6-1. Person: Use a dictionary to store information about a person you know.
# Store their first name, last name, age, and the city in which they live. You
# should have keys such as first_name, last_name, age, and city. Print each
# piece of information stored in your dictionary.
# 6-2. Favorite Numbers: Use a dictionary to store people’s favorite numbers.
# Think of five names, and use them as keys in your dictionary. Think of a favorite
# number for each person, and store each as a value in your dictionary. Print
# each person’s name and their favorite number. For even more fun, poll a few
# friends and get some actual data for your program.
# 6-3. Glossary: A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary.
# However, to avoid confusion, let’s call it a glossary.
# •	 Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the previous
# chapters. Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store their
# meanings as values.
# •	 Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. You might
# print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print the word
# on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. Use the
# newline character (\n) to insert a blank line between each word-meaning
# pair in your output.
