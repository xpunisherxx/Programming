# 7-8. Deli: Make a list called sandwich_orders and fill it with the names of various sandwiches. Then make an empty list called finished_sandwiches. Loop
# through the list of sandwich orders and print a message for each order, such
# as I made your tuna sandwich. As each sandwich is made, move it to the list
# of finished sandwiches. After all the sandwiches have been made, print a
# message listing each sandwich that was made.
# 7-9. No Pastrami: Using the list sandwich_orders from Exercise 7-8, make sure
# the sandwich 'pastrami' appears in the list at least three times. Add code
# near the beginning of your program to print a message saying the deli has
# run out of pastrami, and then use a while loop to remove all occurrences of
# 'pastrami' from sandwich_orders. Make sure no pastrami sandwiches end up
# in finished_sandwiches.
# 7-10. Dream Vacation: Write a program that polls users about their dream vacation. Write a prompt similar to If you could visit one place in the world, where
# would you go? Include a block of code that prints the results of the poll.
