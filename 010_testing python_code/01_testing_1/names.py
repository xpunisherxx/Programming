# We can see that the names generated here are correct. But let’s say we
# want to modify get_formatted_name() so it can also handle middle names.

# As we do so, we want to make sure we don’t break the way the function
# handles names that have only a first and last name. We could test our code
# by running names.py and entering a name like 
# Janis Joplin 
# every time we
# modify get_formatted_name(), but that would become tedious.
# 
# 
# 
#  Fortunately,
# Testing Your Code in
# Python provides an efficient way to automate the testing of a function’s
# output. If we automate the testing of get_formatted_name(), we can always be
# confident that the function will work when given the kinds of names we’ve
# written tests for.
