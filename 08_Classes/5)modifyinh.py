# we will learn about how to modify the attribute value directly

# class Car:

# my_new_car = Car('audi', 'a4', 2019)
#     print(my_new_car.get_descriptive_name())

# can be changed like that

#     my_new_car.odometer_reading = 23
#     my_new_car.read_odometer()




# Incrementing an Attribute’s Value Through a Method




# T ry I T yourse l f



# 9-4. Number Served: Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 162).
# Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0. Create an
# instance called restaurant from this class. Print the number of customers the
# restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again.
# Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number
# of customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and
# print the value again.



# Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment
# the number of customers who’ve been served. Call this method with any number you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a
# day of business.



# 9-5. Login Attempts: Add an attribute called login_attempts to your User
# class from Exercise 9-3 (page 162). Write a method called increment_login
# _attempts() that increments the value of login_attempts by 1. Write another
# method called reset_login_attempts() that resets the value of login_attempts
# to 0.



# Make an instance of the User class and call increment_login_attempts()
# several times. Print the value of login_attempts to make sure it was incremented
# properly, and then call reset_login_attempts(). Print login_attempts again to
# make sure it was reset to 0.
