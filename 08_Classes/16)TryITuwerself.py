# 9-10. Imported Restaurant: Using your latest Restaurant 
# class, store it in a module. Make a separate file that imports
#  Restaurant. Make a Restaurant instance,
# and call one of Restaurantâ€™s methods to show that the import statement 
# is working properly.







# 9-11. Imported Admin: Start with your work from Exercise 9-8 (page 173).
# Store the classes User, Privileges, and Admin in one module. 
# Create a separate file, make an Admin instance, 
# and call show_privileges() to show that
# everything is working correctly.





# 9-12. Multiple Modules: Store the User class in one module, and store the
# Privileges and Admin classes in a separate module. In a separate file, create
# an Admin instance and call show_privileges() to show that everything is still
# working correctly.
