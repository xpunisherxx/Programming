# 8-15. Printing Models: Put the functions for the example printing_models.py in a
# separate file called printing_functions.py. Write an import statement at the top
# of printing_models.py, and modify the file to use the imported functions.



# 8-16. Imports: Using a program you wrote that has one function in it, store that
# function in a separate file. Import the function into your main program file, and
# call the function using each of these approaches:
# import module_name
# from module_name import function_name
# from module_name import function_name as fn
# import module_name as mn
# from module_name import *



# 8-17. Styling Functions: Choose any three programs you wrote for this chapter,
# and make sure they follow the styling guidelines described in this section.
