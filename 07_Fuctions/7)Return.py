# A function doesn’t always have to display its output directly. Instead, it can
# process some data and then return a value or set of values. The value the
# function returns is called a return value. The return statement takes a value
# from inside a function and sends it back to the line that called the function.
# Return values allow you to move much of your program’s grunt work into
# functions, which can simplify the body of your program.
