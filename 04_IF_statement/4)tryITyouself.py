# 5-3. Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a
# variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

# alien_color = 'green'

# # •	 Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print
# # a message that the player just earned 5 points.

# if alien_color == 'green':
#     print('player earned five points')


# # •	 Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that
# # fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)


# if alien_color =='voilet' :
#     print('the color here is not present')
    
# 5-4. Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 5-3, and
# write an if-else chain.

# alien_color = 'voilet'
# if alien_color == 'voilet':
#     print("HELLLYAAWWHH !!! baby , you got 5 points")
# elif alien_color == 'red' :
#     print("the wrong output")

          

# •	 If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned
# 5 points for shooting the alien.

# alien_color = 'voilet'
# if alien_color == 'voilet':
#     print("HELLLYAAWWHH !!! baby , you got 5 points")
# else:
#     print("the wrong output")

# •	 If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned
# 10 points.


# alien_color = 'green'
# if alien_color != 'green':
#     print("You gained 10 points")


# •	 Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that
# runs the else block.



# # 5-5. Alien Colors #3: Turn your if-else chain from Exercise 5-4 into an if-elifelse chain.
# alien_color = 'green'
# # •	 If the alien is green, print a message that the player earned 5 points.
# if alien_color == 'green' :
#     print('You gained 5 points')
# # •	 If the alien is yellow, print a message that the player earned 10 points.
# elif  alien_color == 'yellow':
#     print("You gained 10 points")
# # •	 If the alien is red, print a message that the player earned 15 points.
# elif alien_color == 'red':
    # print("You gained 15 points")


# •	 Write three versions of this program, making sure each message is printed
# for the appropriate color alien.

# 5-6. Stages of Life: Write an if-elif-else chain that determines a person’s
# stage of life. Set a value for the variable age, and then:



# •	 If the person is less than 2 years old, print a message that the person is
# a baby.
# •	 If the person is at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that
# the person is a toddler.
# •	 If the person is at least 4 years old but less than 13, print a message that
# the person is a kid.
# •	 If the person is at least 13 years old but less than 20, print a message that
# the person is a teenager.
# •	 If the person is at least 20 years old but less than 65, print a message that
# the person is an adult.
# •	 If the person is age 65 or older, print a message that the person is an
# elder.
# 5-7. Favorite Fruit: Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of
# independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your list.
# •	 Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
# •	 Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit
# is in your list. If the fruit is in your list, the if block should print a statement,
# such as You really like bananas!
